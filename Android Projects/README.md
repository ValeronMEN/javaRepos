This folder was created for Android projects.

The folder called "EgorHelminth" is a failed test game.

The folder called "EgorHelminth_SurfaceView" consists of the finished Android game called "HELMINTH". It was made using SurfaceView template.

The folder called "RectanglesObstaclesGame" is related to the game I've found surfing YouTube. It is an example of SurfaceView template usage.
