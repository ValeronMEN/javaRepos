This repository was created for studying.

It concerns the applications in Java I've developed.

The folder called "Android Projects" relates to Android Studio projects. For more detailed information read the "README.md" file inside.

The folder called "BTP" concerns Basics of Programming Technologies subject.
It consists of three laboratory works.
The first laboratory work is about regular expressions, text image identification algorithms.
The second one concerns exploring techniques for working with syntactic parsers.
The last one relates to combination and indexation of news from RSS-feeds.
The detailed information for the every work can be found inside the corresponding folder in Ukrainian.

The folder called "Computer Graphics" consists of six laboratory works concerning Computer Graphics subject.
The first one is about creation of a custom image using JavaFX library primitives.
The second one is about construction and animation of images using Java2D.
The third one explores the structure of .bmp files and animation of primitives using JavaFX library tools.
The fourth one concerns construction of the simplest three-dimensional objects and their animation using the Java3D library.
The fifth one is about importing of three-dimensional models into the Java3D programming environment, processing and manipulation of these images.
The last one relates to animation of three-dimensional objects using Java3D.
The detailed information for the every work can be found inside the corresponding folder in Ukrainian.

The folder called "Data Structures and Algorithms" relates to the corresponding subject. There are three laboratory works and one practical work.
The second laboratory work concerns exploring of elementary sorting algorithms - Shaker sort (first part) and Bucket sort (second part).
The third laboratory work is related to studying of data structure "hash table", hashing methods and ways to resolve collisions.
The fourth laboratory work describes exploring of nonlinear structures and acquisition of practical skills in creating and processing search binary trees.
The practical work consists of 3 exercises: Selection sort in the one-way list, Quick sort and Median of three elements sort, deleting an element in the binary tree vs in an unordered array.
The detailed information for the every work can be found inside the corresponding folder in Ukrainian.

The folder called "Minecraft Mods" concerns Minecraft mods I've created. There is one test modification called "Master's Thesis Mod".
